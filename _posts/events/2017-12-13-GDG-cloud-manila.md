<p>Attended the launch of GDG Cloud Manila with my former classmates in college.</p>

<p>Topics are all related to Google Cloud, it is a cloud service similar to AWS offers</p>

<p>After the meetup. I created an account with Google Cloud, where they offer 300 dollars worth of credits when you sign up. And deployed my Spring Boot application using Kubernetes and containers with Docker</p>

<p>Also it is my first time to visit the event venue, it is an awesome cafe and co working space. The art in the wall is cool, which highlighted the classic anime such as Gundam, Slum Dunk, and many more. Check their website: http://www.vccafe.ph/</p>
